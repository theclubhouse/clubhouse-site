# theClubhou.se site generator!

We use [Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com) to generate our
site.  Pelican is a static blogging tool, however, we added a plugin
to generate content based off a Google calendar.

We don't actually use Pelican's blogging features at the moment -- the
fact that it can generate a beautiful layout from a calendar speaks to
Pelican's great flexibility.

This stuff is rough!

## TODO

- Make pelcalendar plugin usable by others
- Make Google Calendar export NOT an ungodly mess.  Current does iCalendar -> markdown -> pelican -> HTML.
